### What
Sklearn-rust is written in Rust (PYO3) and provides a Python API. It focuses on model services, and does not provide model training methods. Instead, it reads the parameters of the trained model and generates a model with a smaller size and a faster prediction speed.


### Requirements
* Python: 3.8+    
* OS: Linux, MacOS and Windows
